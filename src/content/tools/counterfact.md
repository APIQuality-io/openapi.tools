name: Counterfact
description: Counterfact is a revolutionary free and open source mock server. If you have Node installed, all you have to do is run `npx counterfact@latest path-or-url-to-your-openapi-document`. Out of the box, you'll get a mock server that returns random data. With a TypeScript API that's optimized for mocking, you can add more realistic behavior. It supports mix and matching mocks with calls to the real API (sans CORS headaches). With hot reloading and a REPL, you can change things up on the fly.
