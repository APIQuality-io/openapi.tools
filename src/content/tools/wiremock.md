description: WireMock Cloud is a managed, hosted version of WireMock, developed by the same team who wrote the open-source project. It is built on the same technology that powers open source WireMock and is 100% compatible with the WireMock API, with additional features that make it quick and easy to mock any API you depend on. WireMock Cloud also introduces advanced capabilities such as chaos engineering, OpenAPI generation, validation and documentation as well as better collaboration and user management.
