  typeconv is an extremely fast silver bullet type conversion utility.
  It converts between any of its supported types, bidirectionally.
  typeconv lets you convert between type systems which have core-types converters, such as JSON Schema, TypeScript, GraphQL, Open API and SureType. This package can be used as an API programatically or as an application (installed in node_modules/.bin or by using e.g. npx).
